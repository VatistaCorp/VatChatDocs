## Outdated Resources

Koishi's Combo Guide

https://www.evernote.com/shard/s319/sh/66eb1d7d-7b1c-4c46-9462-4f8f1a5fb960/c6b0f1e181b407f9111d70de7665480e

*This is still a decent guide to understanding gem combo theory. However, the combos themselves are very outdated! If you understand the theory involved, please refer to the updated combos.

*Some of these combos may no longer be optimal due to the addition of 2BBB ender in CLR. Additionally, the damage shown has been slightly reduced in CLR. Still, these routes have high value. Particularly:
- corner satellus routes meterlessly set up corner gem pressure loops (w5A det set repeat)
- meter usage at the end of combos (please note corner jFF C Lazer > C Drill is no longer optimal)
- CVO routing at high/low health (early routing to CVO in CLR restricts meter gain for your opponent, which can be strategically useful as well as highly damaging!)

The Neutral Flowchart Copypasta

If I were to give a flowchart for neutral in a good matchup:

* jump back A/B ball to make space
* Are they respecting lazer?
  * Yes -set gem
  * No -lazer
* Are they respecting gem?
  * Yes -concentrate
  * No -detonate
* Do you have vorpal?
  * Yes -time to go in
  * No -continue zoning

Defense.[2]8B

Always remember if you're having trouble getting out of pressure, you can always use conservative shields to gain more flashkick blocks. This will help you win the flashkick cycle, and you can then use flashkick shift to find a gap in your opponent's pressure and safely flashkick.

### Winning the mental game

❎ Playing 'UNI'

* implies knowledge of the deeper fundamentals of the game
* predictable
* mainstream
* not threatening to experienced players
* laughing makes you look like a weirdo

☑️ Doing random funny shit people post in Vatchat

* requires no knowledge of the game's fundamentals
* literally only Vatista players know about it
* not even said Vatista players will do it
* incredibly threatening
* induces more salt by laughing, thus winning the mental game
